Different improvements in the main page:
- “plugin type” filter has been replaced by “plugin categories” and the plugin categories have been simplified and reorganised to a better usability.
- All plugin types can be found in the navigation block inside the block's drawer under Home/Plugins/Plugin types.
- We've removed the “Part of set” and “Purpose” filters due to limited user engagement.

- Filter options have been repositioned and updated in line with the latest Moodle UI styling.
- Number of plugins now is displayed below the filters.
- The sorting functionality has been replaced with a new dropdown to improve usability.
